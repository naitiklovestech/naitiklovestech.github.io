        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Meet Naitik Singhal, the tech maestro with a knack for turning code into comedy! Armed with a keyboard and a killer sense of humor, he's the wizard behind the screen, crafting lines of code and punchlines with equal finesse.</p>

        <p>In the labyrinth of algorithms, Naitik pirouettes through ones and zeros with the agility of a caffeinated cat on a hot tin roof. His mornings start with debugging and coffee, although he argues that coffee is the real debugging fluid for programmers. Donning a T-shirt with a witty programming pun, Naitik is the sartorial sensation of the digital realm.</p>

            <h3>Plant Disease detection model using CNN</h3>
            <p>An easy to use ML model that can detect various types of diseases in plants</p>
            <p>It is only possible for seasoned farmers or botanists to look at a plant and tell the exact disease it is suffering from, hence this ML model was built so that people who keep plants for hobby or just because they like nature can also identify the disease and treat thier leafy friends</p>
