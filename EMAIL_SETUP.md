# üìß Email Integration Setup Guide

## Current Email Implementation

Your website now has **two ways** for visitors to contact you:

- Works immediately, no setup required
- Visitors need their own email client configured

### 2. **Contact Form** (Needs Setup)
- Visitors can fill out a form directly on your website
- Messages are sent directly to your email
- Requires a form submission service
